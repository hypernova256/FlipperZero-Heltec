# Heltec V3 Module for Flipper Zero

This is a GPIO expansion board to use the ESP32-based Heltec V3 LoRa module with the Flipper Zero. I decided to make this project as I was reluctant to purchase LiPo batteries for my Meshtastic/Meshcore modules, and will just use my Flipper for power instead. 

Since these are ESP32 modules, they are compatible with ESP32 apps such as WiFi Marauder along with being Mesh networking modules.

This is my first PCB and CAD project, so feedback would be appreciated.
