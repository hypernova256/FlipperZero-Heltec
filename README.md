# MeshFlipper
## Heltec V3/V4 Module for Flipper Zero
This is a GPIO expansion board to use the ESP32-based Heltec [V3](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/)/[V4](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v4/) LoRa modules with the Flipper Zero. I decided to make this project as I was reluctant to purchase LiPo batteries for my Meshtastic/Meshcore modules, and will just use my Flipper for power instead. This board also contains serial communication for use as a regular ESP32 board.

Since these are ESP32 modules, they are compatible with ESP32 apps such as WiFi Marauder along with being Mesh networking modules.

This is my first PCB and CAD project, so feedback would be greatly appreciated.

I hope to make a 3D Printed case and possibly software such as a Meshtastic client for Flipper as well as possibly multi-booting the ESP32. 


I have made a working prototype with a protoboard at my university makerspace and it works quite well!
